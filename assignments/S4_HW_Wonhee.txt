Essay: What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)?  How do they differ from traditional multi-page
Web Sites?

Single Page Applications are a type of application that is built with a single page navigation.
The architecture of the app is built to dynamically change in the main page instead of taking
the user to a different page each time.  That is the key difference between SPA and a traditional
Multi-page Web Site.  A good example of SPA App based sites are Gmail, Pinterest, and Facebook.
