Essay: What is considered the right size for an image or video asset?

There are 2 aspects of size in media assets (image, video).  First is the file size, how large
is the file size?  The smaller the file size, it is beeter for the user to navigate and will
affect the performance of the site over all.  However, we need to also think about the pixel
size of the assets.  If it requires too much scaling up, the image or video quality will 
deteriorate.  So the key is the right balance of keeping the assets the right physical size 
while keeping the file size as minimal as possible.
