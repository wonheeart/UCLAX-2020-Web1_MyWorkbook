Essay: What do people mean by "Separation of Concerns" in relationship to HTML, CSS and JS?

Separation of concerns is the idea that every module or layer built for a application
should be separated to one responsibility and not contain code that deals with other 
things. 

In relationship to HTML, CSS and JS, this would mean that HTML, CSS and JS all live in 
separate files.
