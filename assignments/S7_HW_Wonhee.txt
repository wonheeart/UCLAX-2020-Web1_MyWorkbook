Essay: What it means for a company to be Agile. What is the purpose of using Agile, and
its Pros and Cons.

Agile development stems from a production method called Kanban (Japanese) which is a approach
to eliminate bottlenecks in production pipeline and quickly shift capacity based on production
needs.  The Kannab method is a production model inspired by the Toyota production system.

Agile in software development further guides process to make it easier for iterative work, 
build instead of document, test early and often, and make collaboration between all functional
teams instead of a step by step process.

The opposite type development is called waterfall, where all the work needs to get documented,
and the devlopment cycle goes through exact steps with eact owners during those steps.

The pros of going agile in a software development is that you get to a result fast, and it is
meant to be very efficient so there are very little idle time.  The con is, you are constantly
changing course and iterating since you start building without the full specs.
